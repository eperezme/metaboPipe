  abstract = {Metabolomics comprises the methods and techniques that are used to measure the small molecule composition of biofluids and tissues, and is actually one of the most rapidly evolving research fields. The determination of the metabolomic profile –the metabolome- has multiple applications in many biological sciences, including the developing of new diagnostic tools in medicine. Recent technological advances in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) are significantly improving our capacity to obtain more data from each biological sample. Consequently, there is a need for fast and accurate statistical and bioinformatic tools that can deal with the complexity and volume of the data generated in metabolomic studies. In this review we provide an update of the most commonly used analytical methods in metabolomics, starting from raw data processing and ending with pathway analysis and biomarker identification. Finally, the integration of metabolomic profiles with molecular data from other high throughput biotechnologies is also reviewed.},

  abstract = {Clotting and anticoagulation of blood samples may give rise to different metabolic profiles of serum and plasma samples, respectively. The anticoagulant used for blood plasma preparation may affect the resulting metabolic profile due to different mechanisms involved in anticoagulation by various agents, e.g. heparin, EDTA and citrate. In the present study, we looked into metabolite and other differences in matched serum and plasma samples and different plasma preparations by using untargeted UPLC-ESI-QTOF/MS profiling and multivariate data analysis (PCA and OPLS-DA). Metabolite differences between serum and plasma samples were mainly related to small peptides reflecting presence or absence of coagulation. Only subtle metabolite differences between the different plasma preparations were noticed, which were primarily related to ion suppression or enhancement caused by citrate and EDTA anticoagulants. For the first time, we also report that anticoagulant counter cation (Na+ or K+) in Na-citrate and K-EDTA plasma can make some metabolites more dominant in ESI-MS. Polymeric material residues originating from blood collection tubes for serum preparation were observed only in serum samples. Hypoxanthine and xanthine were found at higher levels in serum than in plasma samples, possibly due to release from the clot. Mass spectral features of sodium formate and potassium formate ion clusters were detected in citrate and EDTA plasma samples, respectively, originating from formate in mobile phase and Na+ (in Na-citrate tubes) and K+ (in K-EDTA tubes). Among the anticoagulants, heparin is recommended for plasma samples used for LC-ESI/MS-based metabolomics of hydrophilic compounds because no plasma interferences or matrix effects were noticed for this polarity range. Citrate and EDTA should be avoided since interferences and serious matrix effects were encountered on some co-eluting polar metabolites. Serum is recommended as a second choice and an alternative to plasma. In conclusion, heparin plasma or serum should be the order of best choice for LC-ESI/MS-based metabolomics research.},

  abstract = {The reliability and robustness of metabolite assignments in 1H NMR is complicated by numerous factors including variations in temperature, pH, buffer choice, ionic strength, and mixture composition that led to peak overlap and spectral crowding. As sample conditions fluctuate, peak drift and line broadening further complicate peak deconvolution and a subsequent chemical assignment. We present a collection of 1D 1H NMR spectra of 54 common metabolites at varied pH (6.0 to 8.0 in 0.5 step increments) and temperature (290K to 308K) to quantify chemical shift variability to facilitate automated metabolite assignments. Our results illustrate the fundamental challenges with accurately assigning NMR peaks under varied environmental conditions prevalent in complex mixtures. Phosphorylated metabolites showed a larger variation in chemical shifts due to pH, whereas; amino acids showed a higher variation due to temperature. Mixtures of phosphorous compounds showed a consistently poor reliability in achieving an accurate assignment. Phosphorylated cholines, amino acids, and glycerols yielded a 40\% false negative rate for 7 out of 9 mixture conditions. Amino acids had a false negative rate of 57\% at 298K and pH 8. Our results demonstrate that the automated assignments of complex biofluid mixtures requires an expert to intervene to confirm the accuracy of metabolite assignments. Our analysis also indicates the need for reference databases to include spectra under a variety of conditions that includes mixtures and a range of pH and temperature to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of metabolite assignments.,},

  abstract = {Motivation Metabolomics generates complex data necessitating advanced computational methods for generating biological insight. While machine learning (ML) is promising, the challenges of selecting the best algorithms and tuning hyperparameters, particularly for nonexperts, remain. Automated machine learning (AutoML) can streamline this process; however, the issue of interpretability could persist. This research introduces a unified pipeline that combines AutoML with explainable AI (XAI) techniques to optimize metabolomics analysis. Results We tested our approach on two datasets: renal cell carcinoma (RCC) urine metabolomics and ovarian cancer (OC) serum metabolomics. AutoML, using auto-sklearn, surpassed standalone ML algorithms such as SVM and random forest in differentiating between RCC and healthy controls, as well as OC patients and those with other gynecological cancers (Non-OC). Autosklearn employed a mix of algorithms and ensemble techniques, yielding a superior performance (AUC of 0.97 for RCC and 0.85 for OC). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) provided a global ranking of feature importance, identifying dibutylamine and ganglioside GM(d34:1) as the top discriminative metabolites for RCC and OC, respectively. Waterfall plots offered local explanations by illustrating the influence of each metabolite on individual predictions. Dependence plots spotlighted metabolite interactions, such as the connection between hippuric acid and one of its derivatives in RCC, and between GM3(d34:1) and GM3(18:1\_16:0) in OC, hinting at potential mechanistic relationships. Through decision plots, a detailed error analysis was conducted, contrasting feature importance for correctly versus incorrectly classified samples. In essence, our pipeline emphasizes the importance of harmonizing AutoML and XAI, facilitating both simplified ML application and improved interpretability in metabolomics data science.

Dynamic time warping was originally developed as a method for spoken word recognition, but shows potential in the objective analysis of time variant signals, such as manufacturing data. In this work we will discuss the application of dynamic time warping with a derivative weighting function to align chromatograms to facilitate process monitoring and fault detection.

Often, statistical analysis is one of the most difficult challenges and it is critical in the subsequent biological interpretation of the results.

The key purpose of metabolomics is to identify the metabolites corresponding to each biological phenotype, and then provide an analysis of the mechanisms involved. Although metabolomics is important to understand the involved biological phenomena, the approach’s ability to obtain an exhaustive description of the processes is limited. Thus, an analysis-integrated metabolomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and other omics approach is recommended. Such integration of different omics data requires specialized statistical and bioinformatics software. This review focuses on the steps involved in metabolomics research and summarizes several main tools for metabolomics analyses. We also outline the most abnormal metabolic pathways in several cancers and diseases, and discuss the importance of multi-omics integration algorithms. Overall, our goal is to summarize the current metabolomics analysis workflow and its main analysis software to provide useful insights for researchers to establish a preferable pipeline of metabolomics or multi-omics analysis.},

Since its first release in 2009, MetaboAnalyst has evolved significantly to meet the ever-expanding bioinformatics demands from the rapidly growing metabolomics community. In addition to providing a variety of data processing and normalization procedures, MetaboAnalyst supports a wide array of functions for statistical, functional, as well as data visualization tasks. Some of the most widely used approaches include PCA (principal component analysis), PLS-DA (partial least squares discriminant analysis), clustering analysis and visualization, MSEA (metabolite set enrichment analysis), MetPA (metabolic pathway analysis), biomarker selection via ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis, as well as time series and power analysis. The current version of MetaboAnalyst (4.0) features a complete overhaul of the user interface and significantly expanded underlying knowledge bases (compound database, pathway libraries, and metabolite sets). Three new modules have been added to support pathway activity prediction directly from mass peaks, biomarker meta-analysis, and network-based multi-omics data integration. To enable more transparent and reproducible analysis of metabolomic data, we have released a companion R package (MetaboAnalystR) to complement the web-based application.

Furthermore, the upgrade from bulk to single-cell analysis technologies provided unprecedented opportunity to investigate cancer biology at cellular resolution allowing an in depth quantitative analysis of complex and heterogenous diseases. More recently, the advent of functional genomic screening allowed the identification of molecular pathways, cellular processes, biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets that in concert with other technologies allow patient stratification and identification of new treatment regimens. This review is intended to be a guide for researchers to cancer metabolism, highlighting current and emerging technologies, emphasizing advantages, disadvantages and applications with the potential of leading the development of innovative anti-cancer therapies.},

In this chapter, we focus on the later part of the workflow: the preprocessing, pretreatment and data analysis. Thus we will present techniques and approaches that are commonly used for the analysis of metabolomics data. More importantly, we show that the data analysis does not sit in isolation but is instead intimately linked to the experimental steps that have taken place upstream of it. We will demonstrate that this interaction can be used in a beneficial way, by exploring how the knowledge of the experimental steps can inform the correct implementation of statistical techniques and conversely how a better understanding of these interactions can help us to improve the experimental aspects.},

In addition, every experiment is subject to within-platform and other experimental variation, which often includes unwanted biological variation. Such variation must be removed in order to focus on the biological information of interest. We present a broadly applicable method for the removal of unwanted variation arising from various sources for the identification of differentially abundant metabolites and, hence, for the systematic integration of data on the same quantities from different sources. We illustrate the versatility and the performance of the approach in four applications, and we show that it has several advantages over the existing normalization methods.}

There are currently very few approaches to evaluate the variability of metabolomic data in terms of characteristics of individuals or aspects pertaining to technical processing. To address this issue, a method was developed to identify and quantify the contribution of relevant sources of variation in metabolomic data prior to investigation of etiological hypotheses. The Principal Component Partial R-square (PC-PR2) method combines features of principal component and of multivariable linear regression analyses. Within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC), metabolic profiles were determined by 1H NMR analysis on 807 serum samples originating from a nested liver cancer case–control study. PC-PR2 was used to quantify the variability of metabolomic profiles in terms of study subjects age, sex, body mass index, country of origin, smoking status, diabetes and fasting status, as well as factors related to sample processing. PC-PR2 enables the evaluation of important sources of variations in metabolomic studies within large-scale epidemiological investigations.},

  abstract = {Missing values are known to be problematic for the analysis of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics data. Typically these values cover about 10\%–20\% of all data and can originate from various backgrounds, including analytical, computational, as well as biological. Currently, the most well known substitute for missing values is a mean imputation. In fact, some researchers consider this aspect of data analysis in their metabolomics pipeline as so routine that they do not even mention using this replacement approach. However, this may have a significant influence on the data analysis output(s) and might be highly sensitive to the distribution of samples between different classes. Therefore, in this study we have analysed different substitutes of missing values namely: zero, mean, median, k-nearest neighbours (kNN) and random forest (RF) imputation, in terms of their influence on unsupervised and supervised learning and, thus, their impact on the final output(s) in terms of biological interpretation. These comparisons have been demonstrated both visually and computationally (classification rate) to support our findings. The results show that the selection of the replacement methods to impute missing values may have a considerable effect on the classification accuracy, if performed incorrectly this may negatively influence the biomarkers selected for an early disease diagnosis or identification of cancer related metabolites. In the case of GC-MS metabolomics data  studied here our findings recommend that RF should be favored as an imputation of missing  value over the other tested methods. This approach displayed excellent results in terms of classification rate for both supervised methods namely: principal components-linear discriminant analysis (PC-LDA) (98.02\%) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) (97.96\%) outperforming other imputation methods.},

  abstract = {The predominance of partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) used to analyze metabolomics datasets (indeed, it is the most well-known tool to perform classification and regression in metabolomics), can be said to have led to the point that not all researchers are fully aware of alternative multivariate classification algorithms. This may in part be due to the widespread availability of PLS-DA in most of the well-known statistical software packages, where its implementation is very easy if the default settings are used. In addition, one of the perceived advantages of PLS-DA is that it has the ability to analyze highly collinear and noisy data. Furthermore, the calibration model is known to provide a variety of useful statistics, such as prediction accuracy as well as scores and loadings plots. However, this method may provide misleading results, largely due to a lack of suitable statistical validation, when used by non-experts who are not aware of its potential limitations when used in conjunction with metabolomics. This tutorial review aims to provide an introductory overview to several straightforward statistical methods such as principal component-discriminant function analysis (PC-DFA), support vector machines (SVM) and random forests (RF), which could very easily be used either to augment PLS or as alternative supervised learning methods to PLS-DA. These methods can be said to be particularly appropriate for the analysis of large, highly-complex data sets which are common output(s) in metabolomics studies where the numbers of variables often far exceed the number of samples. In addition, these alternative techniques may be useful tools for generating parsimonious models through feature selection and data reduction, as well as providing more propitious results. We sincerely hope that the general reader is left with little doubt that there are several promising and readily available alternatives to PLS-DA, to analyze large and highly complex data sets.},

This motivated the present proposal, in which we introduce DIA-IntOpenStream, a new integrated workflow combining open-source software to streamline MSE data handling. It provides ‘in-house’ custom database construction, allows the conversion of raw MSE data to a universal format (.mzML) and leverages open software (MZmine 3 and MS-DIAL) all advantages for confident annotation and effective MN data interpretation. This pipeline significantly enhances the accessibility, reliability and reproducibility of complex MSE/DIA studies, overcoming previous limitations of proprietary software and non-universal MS data formats that restricted integrative analysis. We demonstrate the utility of DIA-IntOpenStream with two independent datasets: dataset 1 consists of new data from 60 plant extracts from the Ocotea genus; dataset 2 is a publicly available actinobacterial extract spiked with authentic standard for detailed comparative analysis with existing methods. This user-friendly pipeline enables broader adoption of cutting-edge MS tools and provides value to the scientific community. Overall, it holds promise for speeding up metabolite discoveries toward a more collaborative and open environment for research.},

  abstract = {Objective Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. Discussion for Researchers There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, “model,” “type,” and “definition” selections. Discussion for Readers When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95\% confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. Conclusion This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.},

  abstract = {The metabolome of an organism depends on environmental factors and intracellular regulation and provides information about the physiological conditions. Metabolomics helps to understand disease progression in clinical settings or estimate metabolite overproduction for metabolic engineering. The most popular analytical metabolomics platform is mass spectrometry (MS). However, MS metabolome data analysis is complicated, since metabolites interact nonlinearly, and the data structures themselves are complex. Machine learning methods have become immensely popular for statistical analysis due to the inherent nonlinear data representation and the ability to process large and heterogeneous data rapidly. In this review, we address recent developments in using machine learning for processing MS spectra and show how machine learning generates new biological insights. In particular, supervised machine learning has great potential in metabolomics research because of the ability to supply quantitative predictions. We review here commonly used tools, such as random forest, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and genetic algorithms. During processing steps, the supervised machine learning methods help peak picking, normalization, and missing data imputation. For knowledge-driven analysis, machine learning contributes to biomarker detection, classification and regression, biochemical pathway identification, and carbon flux determination. Of important relevance is the combination of different omics data to identify the contributions of the various regulatory levels. Our overview of the recent publications also highlights that data quality determines analysis quality, but also adds to the challenge of choosing the right model for the data. Machine learning methods applied to MS-based metabolomics ease data analysis and can support clinical decisions, guide metabolic engineering, and stimulate fundamental biological discoveries.},

  abstract = {With the advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies such as Illumina, PacBio, and 10X Genomics platforms, and gas/liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, large volumes of biological data in multiple formats can now be obtained through multi-omics analysis. Bioinformatics is constantly evolving and seeking breakthroughs to solve multi-omics problems; however, it is challenging for most experimental biologists to analyse data using command-line interfaces, coding, and scripting. Based on experience with multi-omics, we have developed OmicsSuite, a desktop suite that comprehensively integrates statistics and multi-omics analysis and visualization. The suite has 175 sub-applications in 12 categories, including Sequence, Statistics, Algorithm, Genomics, Transcriptomics, Enrichment, Proteomics, Metabolomics, Clinical, Microorganism, Single Cell, and Table Operation. We created the user interface with Sequence View, Table View, and intelligent components based on JavaFX and the popular Shiny framework. The multi-omics analysis functions were developed based on BioJava and 300+ packages provided by the R CRAN and Bioconductor communities, and it encompasses over 3000 adjustable parameter interfaces. OmicsSuite can directly read multi-omics raw data in FastA, FastQ, Mutation Annotation Format, mzML, Matrix, and HDF5 formats, and the programs emphasize data transfer directions and pipeline analysis functions. OmicsSuite can produce pre-publication images and tables, allowing users to focus on biological aspects. OmicsSuite offers multi-omics step-by-step workflows that can be easily applied to horticultural plant breeding and molecular mechanism studies in plants. It enables researchers to freely explore the molecular information contained in multi-omics big data (Source: https://github.com/OmicsSuite/, Website: https://omicssuite.github.io, v1.3.9).},

  abstract = {To standardize metabolomics data analysis and facilitate future computational developments, it is essential is have a set of well-defined templates for common data structures. Here we describe a collection of data structures involved in metabolomics data processing and illustrate how they are utilized in a full-featured Python-centric pipeline. We demonstrate the performance of the pipeline, and the details in annotation and quality control using large-scale LC-MS metabolomics and lipidomics data and LC-MS/MS data. Multiple previously published datasets are also reanalyzed to showcase its utility in biological data analysis. This pipeline allows users to streamline data processing, quality control, annotation, and standardization in an efficient and transparent manner. This work fills a major gap in the Python ecosystem for computational metabolomics. Author Summary All life processes involve the consumption, creation, and interconversion of metabolites. Metabolomics is the comprehensive study of these small molecules, often using mass spectrometry, to provide critical information of health and disease. Automated processing of such metabolomics data is desired, especially for the bioinformatics community with familiar tools and infrastructures. Despite of Python’s popularity in bioinformatics and machine learning, the Python ecosystem in computational metabolomics still misses a complete data pipeline. We have developed an end-to-end computational metabolomics data processing pipeline, based on the raw data preprocessor Asari [1]. Our pipeline takes experimental data in .mzML or .raw format and outputs annotated feature tables for subsequent biological interpretation. We demonstrate the application of this pipeline to multiple metabolomics and lipidomics datasets. Accompanying the pipeline, we have designed a set of reusable data structures, released as the MetDataModel package, which shall promote more consistent terminology and software interoperability in this area.},

Metabolite signatures that have close proximity to subject’s phenotypic informative dimension, are useful for predicting diagnosis and prognosis of diseases as well as monitoring treatments. The lack of early biomarkers could lead to poor diagnosis and serious outcomes. Therefore, noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring methods with high specificity and selectivity are desperately needed. Small molecule metabolites-based metabolomics has become a specialized tool for metabolic biomarker and pathway analysis, for revealing possible mechanisms of human various diseases and deciphering therapeutic potentials. It could help identify functional biomarkers related to phenotypic variation and delineate biochemical pathways changes as early indicators of pathological dysfunction and damage prior to disease development. Recently, scientists have established a large number of metabolic profiles to reveal the underlying mechanisms and metabolic networks for therapeutic target exploration in biomedicine. This review summarized the metabolic analysis on the potential value of small-molecule candidate metabolites as biomarkers with clinical events, which may lead to better diagnosis, prognosis, drug screening and treatment.

For Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra a possible first preprocessing step is a phase correction which is applied to the Fourier transformed free induction decay (FID) signal. This preprocessing step can be followed by a separate baseline correction step. Especially if series of high-resolution spectra are considered, then automated and computationally fast preprocessing routines are desirable. A new method is suggested that applies the phase and the baseline corrections simultaneously in an automated form without manual input, which distinguishes this work from other approaches. The underlying multi-objective optimization or Pareto optimization provides improved results compared to consecutively applied correction steps. The optimization process uses an objective function which applies strong penalty constraints and weaker regularization conditions. The new method includes an approach for the detection of zero baseline regions. The baseline correction uses a modified Whittaker smoother. The functionality of the new method is demonstrated for experimental NMR spectra. The results are verified against gravimetric data. The method is compared to alternative preprocessing tools. Additionally, the simultaneous correction method is compared to a consecutive application of the two correction steps.},

  abstract = {We define breathomics as the metabolomics study of exhaled air. It is a strongly emerging metabolomics research field that mainly focuses on health-related volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Since the amount of these compounds varies with health status, breathomics holds great promise to deliver non-invasive diagnostic tools. Thus, the main aim of breathomics is to find patterns of VOCs related to abnormal (for instance inflammatory) metabolic processes occurring in the human body. Recently, analytical methods for measuring VOCs in exhaled air with high resolution and high throughput have been extensively developed. Yet, the application of machine learning methods for fingerprinting VOC profiles in the breathomics is still in its infancy. Therefore, in this paper, we describe the current state of the art in data pre-processing and multivariate analysis of breathomics data. We start with the detailed pre-processing pipelines for breathomics data obtained from gas-chromatography mass spectrometry and an ion-mobility spectrometer coupled to multi-capillary columns. The outcome of data pre-processing is a matrix containing the relative abundances of a set of VOCs for a group of patients under different conditions (e.g. disease stage, treatment). Independently of the utilized analytical method, the most important question, ‘which VOCs are discriminatory?’, remains the same. Answers can be given by several modern machine learning techniques (multivariate statistics) and, therefore, are the focus of this paper. We demonstrate the advantages as well the drawbacks of such techniques. We aim to help the community to understand how to profit from a particular method. In parallel, we hope to make the community aware of the existing data fusion methods, as yet unresearched in breathomics.},

In order to fulfil these tasks, various classic projection and clustering methods such as principal component analysis, hierarchical and nonhierarchical clustering methods as well as self-organizing maps have gained popularity in metabolomics, but here, special attention is paid to some new developments and extensions of the chemometric methods that already exist, which are designed to look for a clustering tendency or extreme biological samples in data, to find natural groups of arbitrary shapes, to incorporate the measurement uncertainty estimation within the construction of models and to deal with missing and left-censored data.},

The scientific community has developed a wide range of open source software, providing freely available advanced processing and analysis approaches. The programming and statistics environment R has emerged as one of the most popular environments to process and analyse Metabolomics datasets. A major benefit of such an environment is the possibility of connecting different tools into more complex workflows. Combining reusable data processing R scripts with the experimental data thus allows for open, reproducible research. This review provides an extensive overview of existing packages in R for different steps in a typical computational metabolomics workflow, including data processing, biostatistics, metabolite annotation and identification, and biochemical network and pathway analysis.

Preprocessing/pretreating and normalizing procedures on metabolomics data are usually required before statistical analysis.

We discuss the advantages and limitations of each method. The choice for a suitable preprocessing method is determined by the biological hypothesis, the characteristics of the data set, and the selected statistical data analysis method.

Here we studied the influence of age, body mass index (BMI), and gender on metabolite concentrations in a large cohort of 183 adults by using liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). We implemented a comprehensive statistical workflow for univariate hypothesis testing and modeling by orthogonal partial least-squares (OPLS), which we made available to the metabolomics community within the online Workflow4Metabolomics.org resource. We found 108 urine metabolites displaying concentration variations with either age, BMI, or gender, by integrating the results from univariate p-values and multivariate variable importance in projection (VIP). Several metabolite clusters were further evidenced by correlation analysis, and they allowed stratification of the cohort. In conclusion, our study highlights the impact of gender and age on the urinary metabolome, and thus it indicates that these factors should be taken into account for the design of metabolomics studies.},

  abstract = {Objective Big Data are increasingly used in obesity and nutrition research to gain new insights and derive personalized guidance; however, this data in raw form are often not usable. Substantial preprocessing, which requires machine learning (ML), human judgment, and specialized software, is required to transform Big Data into artificial intelligence (AI)- and ML-ready data. These preprocessing steps are the most complex part of the entire modeling pipeline. Understanding the complexity of these steps by the end user is critical for reducing misunderstanding, faulty interpretation, and erroneous downstream conclusions. Methods We reviewed three popular obesity/nutrition Big Data sources: microbiome, metabolomics, and accelerometry. The preprocessing pipelines, specialized software, challenges, and how decisions impact final AI- and ML-ready products were detailed. Results Opportunities for advances to improve quality control, speed of preprocessing, and intelligent end user consumption were presented. Conclusions Big Data have the exciting potential for identifying new modifiable factors that impact obesity research. However, to ensure accurate interpretation of conclusions arising from Big Data, the choices involved in preparing AI- and ML-ready data need to be transparent to investigators and clinicians relying on the conclusions.},

  abstract = {The life sciences are currently being transformed by an unprecedented wave of developments in molecular analysis, which include important advances in instrumental analysis as well as biocomputing. In light of the central role played by metabolism in nutrition, metabolomics is rapidly being established as a key analytical tool in human nutritional studies. Consequently, an increasing number of nutritionists integrate metabolomics into their study designs. Within this dynamic landscape, the potential of nutritional metabolomics (nutrimetabolomics) to be translated into a science, which can impact on health policies, still needs to be realized. A key element to reach this goal is the ability of the research community to join, to collectively make the best use of the potential offered by nutritional metabolomics. This article, therefore, provides a methodological description of nutritional metabolomics that reflects on the state-of-the-art techniques used in the laboratories of the Food Biomarker Alliance (funded by the European Joint Programming Initiative “A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life” (JPI HDHL)) as well as points of reflections to harmonize this field. It is not intended to be exhaustive but rather to present a pragmatic guidance on metabolomic methodologies, providing readers with useful “tips and tricks” along the analytical workflow.},

Current peak realignment methods are generally time-consuming or align major peaks at the expense of minor peak shift accuracy. We present a novel recursive segment-wise peak alignment (RSPA) method to reduce variability in peak positions across the multiple (1)H NMR spectra used in metabonomic studies. The method refines a segmentation of reference and test spectra in a top-down fashion, sequentially subdividing the initial larger segments, as required, to improve the local spectral alignment. We also describe a general procedure that allows robust comparison of realignment quality of various available methods for a range of peak intensities. The RSPA method is illustrated with respect to 140 (1)H NMR rat urine spectra from a caloric restriction study and is compared with several other widely used peak alignment methods. We demonstrate the superior performance of the RSPA alignment over a wide range of peaks and its capacity to enhance interpretability and robustness of multivariate statistical tools. The approach is widely applicable for NMR-based metabolic studies and is potentially suitable for many other types of data sets such as chromatographic profiles and MS data.},

  abstract = {Pooling metabolomics data across studies is often desirable to increase the statistical power of the analysis. However, this can raise methodological challenges as several preanalytical and analytical factors could introduce differences in measured concentrations and variability between datasets. Specifically, different studies may use variable sample types (e.g., serum versus plasma) collected, treated, and stored according to different protocols, and assayed in different laboratories using different instruments. To address these issues, a new pipeline was developed to normalize and pool metabolomics data through a set of sequential steps: (i) exclusions of the least informative observations and metabolites and removal of outliers; imputation of missing data; (ii) identification of the main sources of variability through principal component partial R-square (PC-PR2) analysis; (iii) application of linear mixed models to remove unwanted variability, including samples’ originating study and batch, and preserve biological variations while accounting for potential differences in the residual variances across studies. This pipeline was applied to targeted metabolomics data acquired using Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ kits in eight case-control studies nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. Comprehensive examination of metabolomics measurements indicated that the pipeline improved the comparability of data across the studies. Our pipeline can be adapted to normalize other molecular data, including biomarkers as well as proteomics data, and could be used for pooling molecular datasets, for example in international consortia, to limit biases introduced by inter-study variability. This versatility of the pipeline makes our work of potential interest to molecular epidemiologists.},

Various methods have been applied for handling missing values, but the selection can significantly affect following data analyses. Typically, there are three types of missing values, missing not at random (MNAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing completely at random (MCAR). Our study comprehensively compared eight imputation methods (zero, half minimum (HM), mean, median, random forest (RF), singular value decomposition (SVD), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and quantile regression imputation of left-censored data (QRILC)) for different types of missing values using four metabolomics datasets. Normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) and NRMSE-based sum of ranks (SOR) were applied to evaluate imputation accuracy. Principal component analysis (PCA)/partial least squares (PLS)-Procrustes analysis were used to evaluate the overall sample distribution. Student’s t-test followed by correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects on univariate statistics. Our findings demonstrated that RF performed the best for MCAR/MAR and QRILC was the favored one for left-censored MNAR. Finally, we proposed a comprehensive strategy and developed a public-accessible web-tool for the application of missing value imputation in metabolomics (https://metabolomics.cc.hawaii.edu/software/MetImp/).},

One of the challenges is that differences of the low abundant metabolites between groups are often masked by the high variation of abundant metabolites -. In order to solve this challenge, a novel data preprocessing strategy consisting of 3 steps was proposed in this study. In step 1, a ‘modified 80\%’ rule was used to reduce effect of missing values; in step 2, unit-variance and Pareto scaling methods were used to reduce the mask effect from the abundant metabolites. In step 3, in order to fix the adverse effect of scaling, stability information of the variables deduced from intensity information and the class information, was used to assign suitable weights to the variables. When applying to an LC/MS based metabolomics dataset from chronic hepatitis B patients study and two simulated datasets, the mask effect was found to be partially eliminated and several new low abundant differential metabolites were rescued.},

Data imputation is a common method to deal with missing metabolomics data, while traditional data imputation methods usually ignore the differences in missing types, and thus the results of data imputation are not satisfactory. In order to discriminate the missing types of metabolomics data, a missing data classification model (PX-MDC) based on particle swarm algorithm and XGBoost is proposed in this paper. First, the missing values in a given missing data set are obtained by panning the missing values to obtain the largest subset of complete data, and then the particle swarm algorithm is used to search for the concentration threshold of missing data and the proportion of low concentration deletions as a percentage of overall deletions. Next, the missing data are simulated based on the search results. Finally, the training data are trained using the XGBoost model using the feature set proposed in this paper in order to build a classifier for the missing data. The experimental results show that the particle swarm algorithm is able to match the traditional enumeration method in terms of accuracy and significantly reduce the search time in concentration threshold search. Compared with the current mainstream methods, the PX-MDC model designed in this paper exhibits higher accuracy and is able to distinguish different deletion types for the same metabolite. This study is expected to make an important breakthrough in metabolomics data imputation and provide strong support for research in related fields.},

  abstract = {In this review, we summarize established and recent bioinformatic and statistical methods for the analysis of NMR-based metabolomics. Data analysis of NMR metabolic fingerprints exhibits several challenges, including unwanted biases, high dimensionality, and typically low sample numbers. Common analysis tasks comprise the identification of differential metabolites and the classification of specimens. However, analysis results strongly depend on the preprocessing of the data, and there is no consensus yet on how to remove unwanted biases and experimental variance prior to statistical analysis. Here, we first review established and new preprocessing protocols and illustrate their pros and cons, including different data normalizations and transformations. Second, we give a brief overview of state-of-the-art statistical analysis in NMR-based metabolomics. Finally, we discuss a recent development in statistical data analysis, where data normalization becomes obsolete. This method, called zero-sum regression, builds metabolite signatures whose estimation as well as predictions are independent of prior normalization.},

  abstract = {Metabolomics is a promising “omics” field in systems biology; its objective is comprehensive analysis of low-molecular-weight endogenous metabolites in a biological sample. It could enable mapping of perturbations of early biochemical changes in diseases and hence provide an opportunity to develop predictive biomarkers that could result in earlier intervention and provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of diseases. Because of the possible discovery of clinically relevant biomarkers, metabolomics has potential advantages that routine approaches to clinical diagnosis do not. Monitoring specific metabolite levels in serum, the most commonly used biofluid in metabolomics, has become an important way of detecting the early stages of a disease. Serum is a readily accessible and informative biofluid, making it ideal for early detection of a wide range of diseases, and analysis of serum has several advantages over analysis of other biofluids. Metabolite profiles of serum can be regarded as important indicators of physiological and pathological states and may aid understanding of the mechanism of disease occurrence and progression on the metabolic level, and provide information enabling identification of early and differential metabolic markers of disease. Analysis of these crucial metabolites in serum has become important in monitoring the state of biological organisms and is widely used for diagnosis of disease. Emerging metabolomics will drive serum analysis, facilitate and improve the development of disease treatments, and provide great benefits for public health in the long-term.},
