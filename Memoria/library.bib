  abstract = {Machine learning has greatly advanced over the past decade, owing to advances in algorithmic innovations, hardware acceleration, and benchmark datasets to train on domains such as computer vision, natural-language processing, and more recently the life sciences. In particular, the subfield of machine learning known as deep learning has found applications in genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. However, a thorough assessment of how the data preprocessing methods required for the analysis of life science data affect the performance of deep learning is lacking. This work contributes to filling that gap by assessing the impact of commonly used as well as newly developed methods employed in data preprocessing workflows for metabolomics that span from raw data to processed data. The results from these analyses are summarized into a set of best practices that can be used by researchers as a starting point for downstream classification and reconstruction tasks using deep learning.},

  abstract = {Clotting and anticoagulation of blood samples may give rise to different metabolic profiles of serum and plasma samples, respectively. The anticoagulant used for blood plasma preparation may affect the resulting metabolic profile due to different mechanisms involved in anticoagulation by various agents, e.g. heparin, EDTA and citrate. In the present study, we looked into metabolite and other differences in matched serum and plasma samples and different plasma preparations by using untargeted UPLC-ESI-QTOF/MS profiling and multivariate data analysis (PCA and OPLS-DA). Metabolite differences between serum and plasma samples were mainly related to small peptides reflecting presence or absence of coagulation. Only subtle metabolite differences between the different plasma preparations were noticed, which were primarily related to ion suppression or enhancement caused by citrate and EDTA anticoagulants. For the first time, we also report that anticoagulant counter cation (Na+ or K+) in Na-citrate and K-EDTA plasma can make some metabolites more dominant in ESI-MS. Polymeric material residues originating from blood collection tubes for serum preparation were observed only in serum samples. Hypoxanthine and xanthine were found at higher levels in serum than in plasma samples, possibly due to release from the clot. Mass spectral features of sodium formate and potassium formate ion clusters were detected in citrate and EDTA plasma samples, respectively, originating from formate in mobile phase and Na+ (in Na-citrate tubes) and K+ (in K-EDTA tubes). Among the anticoagulants, heparin is recommended for plasma samples used for LC-ESI/MS-based metabolomics of hydrophilic compounds because no plasma interferences or matrix effects were noticed for this polarity range. Citrate and EDTA should be avoided since interferences and serious matrix effects were encountered on some co-eluting polar metabolites. Serum is recommended as a second choice and an alternative to plasma. In conclusion, heparin plasma or serum should be the order of best choice for LC-ESI/MS-based metabolomics research.},

  abstract = {The reliability and robustness of metabolite assignments in 1H NMR is complicated by numerous factors including variations in temperature, pH, buffer choice, ionic strength, and mixture composition that led to peak overlap and spectral crowding. As sample conditions fluctuate, peak drift and line broadening further complicate peak deconvolution and a subsequent chemical assignment. We present a collection of 1D 1H NMR spectra of 54 common metabolites at varied pH (6.0 to 8.0 in 0.5 step increments) and temperature (290K to 308K) to quantify chemical shift variability to facilitate automated metabolite assignments. Our results illustrate the fundamental challenges with accurately assigning NMR peaks under varied environmental conditions prevalent in complex mixtures. Phosphorylated metabolites showed a larger variation in chemical shifts due to pH, whereas; amino acids showed a higher variation due to temperature. Mixtures of phosphorous compounds showed a consistently poor reliability in achieving an accurate assignment. Phosphorylated cholines, amino acids, and glycerols yielded a 40\% false negative rate for 7 out of 9 mixture conditions. Amino acids had a false negative rate of 57\% at 298K and pH 8. Our results demonstrate that the automated assignments of complex biofluid mixtures requires an expert to intervene to confirm the accuracy of metabolite assignments. Our analysis also indicates the need for reference databases to include spectra under a variety of conditions that includes mixtures and a range of pH and temperature to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of metabolite assignments.,},

  abstract = {Motivation Metabolomics generates complex data necessitating advanced computational methods for generating biological insight. While machine learning (ML) is promising, the challenges of selecting the best algorithms and tuning hyperparameters, particularly for nonexperts, remain. Automated machine learning (AutoML) can streamline this process; however, the issue of interpretability could persist. This research introduces a unified pipeline that combines AutoML with explainable AI (XAI) techniques to optimize metabolomics analysis. Results We tested our approach on two datasets: renal cell carcinoma (RCC) urine metabolomics and ovarian cancer (OC) serum metabolomics. AutoML, using auto-sklearn, surpassed standalone ML algorithms such as SVM and random forest in differentiating between RCC and healthy controls, as well as OC patients and those with other gynecological cancers (Non-OC). Autosklearn employed a mix of algorithms and ensemble techniques, yielding a superior performance (AUC of 0.97 for RCC and 0.85 for OC). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) provided a global ranking of feature importance, identifying dibutylamine and ganglioside GM(d34:1) as the top discriminative metabolites for RCC and OC, respectively. Waterfall plots offered local explanations by illustrating the influence of each metabolite on individual predictions. Dependence plots spotlighted metabolite interactions, such as the connection between hippuric acid and one of its derivatives in RCC, and between GM3(d34:1) and GM3(18:1\_16:0) in OC, hinting at potential mechanistic relationships. Through decision plots, a detailed error analysis was conducted, contrasting feature importance for correctly versus incorrectly classified samples. In essence, our pipeline emphasizes the importance of harmonizing AutoML and XAI, facilitating both simplified ML application and improved interpretability in metabolomics data science.

  abstract = {Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, what is it, how does it work and why is it useful? So in the past, we’ve talked quite a lot about different chromatographies, playlist linked by the end of the video, in addition to a few techniques relating to mass spectrometry such as MALDI-TOF. Now, liquid chromatography (LC) is a technique used for separating compounds in a sample based on their affinity to some other molecule and can be paired with mass spectrometry (MS) for further analysis. In other words, it is the merging of these two different techniques! After chromatographic separation, the compounds are desolvated into the gas phase and ionized at an ionization source, and are then introduced into the mass spectrometer for mass analysis. Liquid chromatography is a good separation technique, especially for larger and non-volatile molecules such as proteins and complex peptides. Combining this with mass spectrometry is especially useful since we can use different types of column chemistries for broad sample coverage.  Liquid chromatography is in fact so efficient that it has largely replaced gel electrophoresis for molecular separation. LC is also especially well suited for pairing with MS since it reduces ion suppression which in turn would impede complete ionization needed for MS. An improved version of LC called high performance liquid chromatography also exists and has largely replaced regular liquid chromatography. The four main types of LC are partition chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, size-exclusion chromatography and affinity chromatography and you can find all four of these chromatographies in my protein purification playlist, linked by the end of this video. Also, if you have found the video useful so far, please give it a quick like! In a nutshell, LC workflow is carried out in the following manner: A column, contains a mobile phase as well as a stationary phase. The interaction between our sample and the stationary phase, causes the different compounds in our sample to separate based on some unique difference in quality of these compounds such as size, charge or level of hydrophobicity. When the mobile phase flows out the column, it passes through a detector which “registers” a certain physical or chemical property such as refractive index or light absorption. This is displayed as a signal or “peak”, which corresponds to the amount of the component in the sample. The time at which the analyte is detected is called its RT and compounds of the sample can be confirmed through comparison of their RT to known RTs. However, this is not very reliable and requires secondary confirmation. Now, the sample can move on to the mass spectrometer. The LC and the MS are coupled through an interface. The solvent is evaporated through the application of heat and analyte molecules are vaporized and ionized. This is crucial because the MS can only measure gas phase ions. Electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) are the two most commonly used ionization methods in LC-MS analysis. Then the analyte ions are drawn into the mass spectrometer, where they are subjected to electric fields and/or magnetic fields. The flight paths of the ions are altered by varying the applied fields which ensures their separation from another on the basis of their mass-to-charge (m/z) values. Post-separation, the ions can be collected and detected by a variety of mass detectors, the most common one being the electron-multiplier. The abundances of the ions measured during the analysis of a sample by LC-MS are plotted as a total ion chromatogram (TIC). The plot displays the peak intensities of the analyte ions versus their RT. Further, each point in the chromatogram is associated with the mass spectrum which depicts the ion abundances versus the measured m/z values.}

  abstract = {The goal of metabolomics is to measure the entire range of small organic molecules in biological samples. In liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, formidable analytical challenges remain in removing the nonbiological factors that affect chromatographic peak areas. These factors include sample matrix-induced ion suppression, chromatographic quality, and analytical drift. The combination of these factors is referred to as obscuring variation. Some metabolomics samples can exhibit intense obscuring variation due to matrix-induced ion suppression, rendering large amounts of data unreliable and difficult to interpret. Existing normalization techniques have limited applicability to these sample types. Here we present a data normalization method to minimize the effects of obscuring variation. We normalize peak areas using a batch-specific normalization process, which matches measured metabolites with isotope-labeled internal standards that behave similarly during the analysis. This method, called best-matched internal standard (B-MIS) normalization, can be applied to targeted or untargeted metabolomics data sets and yields relative concentrations. We evaluate and demonstrate the utility of B-MIS normalization using marine environmental samples and laboratory grown cultures of phytoplankton. In untargeted analyses, B-MIS normalization allowed for inclusion of mass features in downstream analyses that would have been considered unreliable without normalization due to obscuring variation. B-MIS normalization for targeted or untargeted metabolomics is freely available at https://github.com/IngallsLabUW/B-MIS-normalization.},

Often, statistical analysis is one of the most difficult challenges and it is critical in the subsequent biological interpretation of the results. Because of this, combined with the computational programming skills needed for this type of analysis, several bioinformatic tools aimed at simplifying metabolomics and proteomics data analysis have emerged. However, sometimes the analysis is still limited to a few hidebound statistical methods and to data sets with limited flexibility. POMAShiny is a web-based tool that provides a structured, flexible and user-friendly workflow for the visualization, exploration and statistical analysis of metabolomics and proteomics data. This tool integrates several statistical methods, some of them widely used in other types of omics, and it is based on the POMA R/Bioconductor package, which increases the reproducibility and flexibility of analyses outside the web environment.

However, both techniques involve extensive data processing, which can be performed by a multitude of different software solutions. Analysis of quantitative LC-MS/MS data is mainly performed in three major steps: processing of raw data, normalization, and statistical analysis. To evaluate the impact of data processing steps, we developed two new benchmark data sets, one each for DDA and SRM, with samples consisting of a long-range dilution series of synthetic peptides spiked in a total cell protein digest. The generated data were processed by eight different software workflows and three postprocessing steps. The results show that the choice of the raw data processing software and the postprocessing steps play an important role in the final outcome. Also, the linear dynamic range of the DDA data could be extended by an order of magnitude through feature alignment and a charge state merging algorithm proposed here. Furthermore, the benchmark data sets are made publicly available for further benchmarking and software developments.}

Thus, an analysis-integrated metabolomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and other omics approach is recommended. Such integration of different omics data requires specialized statistical and bioinformatics software. This review focuses on the steps involved in metabolomics research and summarizes several main tools for metabolomics analyses. We also outline the most abnormal metabolic pathways in several cancers and diseases, and discuss the importance of multi-omics integration algorithms.

Since its first release in 2009, MetaboAnalyst has evolved significantly to meet the ever-expanding bioinformatics demands from the rapidly growing metabolomics community. In addition to providing a variety of data processing and normalization procedures, MetaboAnalyst supports a wide array of functions for statistical, functional, as well as data visualization tasks. Some of the most widely used approaches include PCA (principal component analysis), PLS-DA (partial least squares discriminant analysis), clustering analysis and visualization, MSEA (metabolite set enrichment analysis), MetPA (metabolic pathway analysis), biomarker selection via ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis, as well as time series and power analysis. The current version of MetaboAnalyst (4.0) features a complete overhaul of the user interface and significantly expanded underlying knowledge bases (compound database, pathway libraries, and metabolite sets). Three new modules have been added to support pathway activity prediction directly from mass peaks, biomarker meta-analysis, and network-based multi-omics data integration. To enable more transparent and reproducible analysis of metabolomic data, we have released a companion R package (MetaboAnalystR) to complement the web-based application.

In this review, we have focused on NMR-based nutrimetabolomics strategies and their role in identifying dietary and disease related biomarkers of significance to human nutrition and health. Moreover, this NMR-based metabolomics can play a significant role in determining, understanding, and regulating metabolites involved in the multidimensional and complex area of functional foods and diet-related metabolic diseases.

  abstract = {Human urine recently became a popular medium for metabolomics biomarker discovery because its collection is non-invasive. Sometimes renal dilution of urine can be problematic in this type of urinary biomarker analysis. Currently, various normalization techniques such as creatinine ratio, osmolality, specific gravity, dry mass, urine volume, and area under the curve are used to account for the renal dilution. However, these normalization techniques have their own drawbacks. In this project, mass spectrometry-based urinary metabolomic data obtained from prostate cancer (n\,=\,56), bladder cancer (n\,=\,57) and control (n\,=\,69) groups were analyzed using statistical normalization techniques. The normalization techniques investigated in this study are Creatinine Ratio, Log Value, Linear Baseline, Cyclic Loess, Quantile, Probabilistic Quotient, Auto Scaling, Pareto Scaling, and Variance Stabilizing Normalization. The appropriate summary statistics for comparison of normalization techniques were created using variances, coefficients of variation, and boxplots. For each normalization technique, a principal component analysis was performed to identify clusters based on cancer type. In addition, hypothesis tests were conducted to determine if the normalized biomarkers could be used to differentiate between the cancer types. The results indicate that the determination of statistical significance can be dependent upon which normalization method is utilized. Therefore, careful consideration should go into choosing an appropriate normalization technique as no method had universally superior performance.},

Within a cell or a tissue, the metabolites constitute the direct signature of the molecular phenotype and thus their profiling has concrete clinical applications in oncology. Metabolomics and fluxomics, are key technological approaches that mainly revolutionized the field enabling researchers to have both a qualitative and mechanistic model of the biochemical activities in cancer. Furthermore, the upgrade from bulk to single-cell analysis technologies provided unprecedented opportunity to investigate cancer biology at cellular resolution allowing an in depth quantitative analysis of complex and heterogenous diseases. More recently, the advent of functional genomic screening allowed the identification of molecular pathways, cellular processes, biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets that in concert with other technologies allow patient stratification and identification of new treatment regimens.

  abstract = {Due to variation in instrument response caused by various sources of errors throughout an analytical assay, data normalization plays an indispensable role in untargeted LC-MS profiling, yet limited accepted guidelines on this topic exist. In this work, a systematic comparison of several normalization techniques, mainly focusing on internal standard-based approaches, has been performed to derive some general recommendations. For generation of untargeted lipidomic data, a comprehensive ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-electrospray ionization (ESI)-quadrupole time of flight (QTOF)-MS/MS method was utilized. To monitor instrument stability and evaluate normalization performance, quality control (QC) samples, prepared from aliquots of all experimental samples, were embedded in the sequence. Stable isotope labeled standards, representing differing lipid classes, were spiked to each sample as internal standards for postacquisition normalization. Various metrics were used to compare distinct normalization strategies, with reduction of variation in QC samples being the critical requirement for acceptance of successful normalization. The comparison of intragroup coefficients of variation (CVs), median absolute deviations (MADs), and variance enables simple selection of the best performance of normalization with improved and coherent results. Furthermore, the importance for normalization in critical data sets, showing only minor effects between groups with high variation and outliers, is pointed out. Apart from normalization, also, influences of used raw data types are demonstrated. In addition, effects of various factors throughout the processing workflow were investigated and optimized. Eventually, implementation of quality control samples, even if not required for normalization, provided a useful basis for assessing data quality. Due to lack of consensus for selecting optimum normalization, suggestions for validating data integrity are given.},

There are currently very few approaches to evaluate the variability of metabolomic data in terms of characteristics of individuals or aspects pertaining to technical processing. To address this issue, a method was developed to identify and quantify the contribution of relevant sources of variation in metabolomic data prior to investigation of etiological hypotheses. The Principal Component Partial R-square (PC-PR2) method combines features of principal component and of multivariable linear regression analyses. Within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC), metabolic profiles were determined by 1H NMR analysis on 807 serum samples originating from a nested liver cancer case–control study. PC-PR2 was used to quantify the variability of metabolomic profiles in terms of study subjects age, sex, body mass index, country of origin, smoking status, diabetes and fasting status, as well as factors related to sample processing. PC-PR2 enables the evaluation of important sources of variations in metabolomic studies within large-scale epidemiological investigations.},

  abstract = {, The implementation of quality control strategies is crucial to ensure the reproducibility, accuracy, and meaningfulness of metabolomics data. However, this pivotal step is often overlooked within the metabolomics workflow and frequently relies on the use of nonstandardized and poorly reported protocols. To address current limitations in this respect, we have developed QComics, a robust, easily implementable and reportable method for monitoring and controlling data quality. The protocol operates in various sequential steps aimed to (i) correct for background noise and carryover, (ii) detect signal drifts and “out-of-control” observations, (iii) deal with missing data, (iv) remove outliers, (v) monitor quality markers to identify samples affected by improper collection, preprocessing, or storage, and (vi) assess overall data quality in terms of precision and accuracy. Notably, this tool considers important issues often neglected along quality control, such as the need of separately handling missing values and truly absent data to avoid losing relevant biological information, as well as the large impact that preanalytical factors may elicit on metabolomics results. Altogether, the guidelines compiled in QComics might contribute to establishing gold standard recommendations and best practices for quality control within the metabolomics community.},

  abstract = {Accurate dietary assessment is a challenge in nutritional research, needing powerful and robust tools for reliable measurement of food intake biomarkers. In this work, we have developed a novel quantitative dietary fingerprinting (QDF) approach, which enables for the first time the simultaneous quantitation of about 350 urinary food-derived metabolites, including (poly)phenolic aglycones, phase II metabolites, and microbial-transformed compounds, as well as other compounds (e.g., glucosinolates, amino acid derivatives, methylxanthines, alkaloids, and markers of alcohol and tobacco consumption). This method was fully validated for 220 metabolites, yielding good linearity, high sensitivity and precision, accurate recovery rates, and negligible matrix effects. Furthermore, 127 additional phase II metabolites were also included in this method after identification in urines collected from acute dietary interventions with various foods. Thus, this metabolomic approach represents one-step further toward precision nutrition and the objective of improving the accurateness and comprehensiveness in the assessment of dietary patterns and lifestyles.},

  abstract = {Missing values are known to be problematic for the analysis of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics data. Typically these values cover about 10\%–20\% of all data and can originate from various backgrounds, including analytical, computational, as well as biological. Currently, the most well known substitute for missing values is a mean imputation. In fact, some researchers consider this aspect of data analysis in their metabolomics pipeline as so routine that they do not even mention using this replacement approach. However, this may have a significant influence on the data analysis output(s) and might be highly sensitive to the distribution of samples between different classes. Therefore, in this study we have analysed different substitutes of missing values namely: zero, mean, median, k-nearest neighbours (kNN) and random forest (RF) imputation, in terms of their influence on unsupervised and supervised learning and, thus, their impact on the final output(s) in terms of biological interpretation. These comparisons have been demonstrated both visually and computationally (classification rate) to support our findings. The results show that the selection of the replacement methods to impute missing values may have a considerable effect on the classification accuracy, if performed incorrectly this may negatively influence the biomarkers selected for an early disease diagnosis or identification of cancer related metabolites. In the case of GC-MS metabolomics data  studied here our findings recommend that RF should be favored as an imputation of missing  value over the other tested methods. This approach displayed excellent results in terms of classification rate for both supervised methods namely: principal components-linear discriminant analysis (PC-LDA) (98.02\%) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) (97.96\%) outperforming other imputation methods.},

  abstract = {The predominance of partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) used to analyze metabolomics datasets (indeed, it is the most well-known tool to perform classification and regression in metabolomics), can be said to have led to the point that not all researchers are fully aware of alternative multivariate classification algorithms. This may in part be due to the widespread availability of PLS-DA in most of the well-known statistical software packages, where its implementation is very easy if the default settings are used. In addition, one of the perceived advantages of PLS-DA is that it has the ability to analyze highly collinear and noisy data. Furthermore, the calibration model is known to provide a variety of useful statistics, such as prediction accuracy as well as scores and loadings plots. However, this method may provide misleading results, largely due to a lack of suitable statistical validation, when used by non-experts who are not aware of its potential limitations when used in conjunction with metabolomics. This tutorial review aims to provide an introductory overview to several straightforward statistical methods such as principal component-discriminant function analysis (PC-DFA), support vector machines (SVM) and random forests (RF), which could very easily be used either to augment PLS or as alternative supervised learning methods to PLS-DA. These methods can be said to be particularly appropriate for the analysis of large, highly-complex data sets which are common output(s) in metabolomics studies where the numbers of variables often far exceed the number of samples. In addition, these alternative techniques may be useful tools for generating parsimonious models through feature selection and data reduction, as well as providing more propitious results. We sincerely hope that the general reader is left with little doubt that there are several promising and readily available alternatives to PLS-DA, to analyze large and highly complex data sets.},

  abstract = {The complexity of biological samples poses a major challenge for reliable compound identification in mass spectrometry (MS). The presence of interfering compounds that cause additional peaks in the spectrum can make interpretation and assignment difficult. To overcome this issue, new approaches are needed to reduce complexity and simplify spectral interpretation. Recently, focused on unknown metabolite identification, we presented a new approach, RANSY (ratio analysis of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Anal. Chem. 2011, 83, 7616–7623), which extracts the 1H signals related to the same metabolite based on peak intensity ratios. On the basis of this concept, we present the ratio analysis of mass spectrometry (RAMSY) method, which facilitates improved compound identification in complex MS spectra. RAMSY works on the principle that, under a given set of experimental conditions, the abundance/intensity ratios between the mass fragments from the same metabolite are relatively constant. Therefore, the quotients of average peak ratios and their standard deviations, generated using a small set of MS spectra from the same ion chromatogram, efficiently allow the statistical recovery of the metabolite peaks and facilitate reliable identification. RAMSY was applied to both gas chromatography/MS and liquid chromatography tandem MS (LC–MS/MS) data to demonstrate its utility. The performance of RAMSY is typically better than the results from correlation methods. RAMSY promises to improve unknown metabolite identification for MS users in metabolomics or other fields.},

  abstract = {The metabolic syndrome is a multifactorial disease developed due to accumulation and chronification of several risk factors associated with disrupted metabolism. The early detection of the biomarkers by NMR spectroscopy could be helpful to prevent multifactorial diseases. The exposure of each risk factor can be detected by traditional molecular markers but the current biomarkers have not been enough precise to detect the primary stages of disease. Thus, there is a need to obtain novel molecular markers of pre-disease stages. A promising source of new molecular markers are metabolomics standing out the research of biomarkers in NMR approaches. An increasing number of nutritionists integrate metabolomics into their study design, making nutrimetabolomics one of the most promising avenues for improving personalized nutrition. This review highlight the major five risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome and related diseases including carbohydrate dysfunction, dyslipidemia, oxidative stress, inflammation, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Together, it is proposed a profile of metabolites of each risk factor obtained from NMR approaches to target them using personalized nutrition, which will improve the quality of life for these patients.},

Each step of the analytical and statistical pipeline is crucial for the generation of high-quality, robust data.

Here, we outline the key steps of the metabolomics workflow and provide details on important parameters and considerations. Studies should be designed carefully to ensure appropriate statistical power and adequate controls. Subsequent sample handling and preparation should avoid the introduction of bias, which can significantly affect downstream data interpretation. It is not possible to cover the entire metabolome with a single platform; therefore, the analytical platform should reflect the biological sample under investigation and the question(s) under consideration. The large, complex datasets produced need to be pre-processed in order to extract meaningful information. Finally, the most time-consuming steps are metabolite identification, as well as metabolic pathway and network analysis.

  abstract = {Liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry data-independent acquisition (LC-HRMS/DIA), including MSE, enable comprehensive metabolomics analyses though they pose challenges for data processing with automatic annotation and molecular networking (MN) implementation. This motivated the present proposal, in which we introduce DIA-IntOpenStream, a new integrated workflow combining open-source software to streamline MSE data handling. It provides ‘in-house’ custom database construction, allows the conversion of raw MSE data to a universal format (.mzML) and leverages open software (MZmine 3 and MS-DIAL) all advantages for confident annotation and effective MN data interpretation. This pipeline significantly enhances the accessibility, reliability and reproducibility of complex MSE/DIA studies, overcoming previous limitations of proprietary software and non-universal MS data formats that restricted integrative analysis. We demonstrate the utility of DIA-IntOpenStream with two independent datasets: dataset 1 consists of new data from 60 plant extracts from the Ocotea genus; dataset 2 is a publicly available actinobacterial extract spiked with authentic standard for detailed comparative analysis with existing methods. This user-friendly pipeline enables broader adoption of cutting-edge MS tools and provides value to the scientific community. Overall, it holds promise for speeding up metabolite discoveries toward a more collaborative and open environment for research.},

This dataset represents a systematic evaluation of the reproducibility of a multi-batch DIMS metabolomics study of cardiac tissue extracts. It comprises of twenty biological samples (cow vs. sheep) that were analysed repeatedly, in 8 batches across 7 days, together with a concurrent set of quality control (QC) samples. Data are presented from each step of the workflow and are available in MetaboLights. The strength of the dataset is that intra- and inter-batch variation can be corrected using QC spectra and the quality of this correction assessed independently using the repeatedly-measured biological samples. Originally designed to test the efficacy of a batch-correction algorithm, it will enable others to evaluate novel data processing algorithms. Furthermore, this dataset serves as a benchmark for DIMS metabolomics, derived using best-practice workflows and rigorous quality assessment.},

  abstract = {Objective Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. Discussion for Researchers There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, “model,” “type,” and “definition” selections. Discussion for Readers When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95\% confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. Conclusion This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.},

  abstract = {The metabolome of an organism depends on environmental factors and intracellular regulation and provides information about the physiological conditions. Metabolomics helps to understand disease progression in clinical settings or estimate metabolite overproduction for metabolic engineering. The most popular analytical metabolomics platform is mass spectrometry (MS). However, MS metabolome data analysis is complicated, since metabolites interact nonlinearly, and the data structures themselves are complex. Machine learning methods have become immensely popular for statistical analysis due to the inherent nonlinear data representation and the ability to process large and heterogeneous data rapidly. In this review, we address recent developments in using machine learning for processing MS spectra and show how machine learning generates new biological insights. In particular, supervised machine learning has great potential in metabolomics research because of the ability to supply quantitative predictions. We review here commonly used tools, such as random forest, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and genetic algorithms. During processing steps, the supervised machine learning methods help peak picking, normalization, and missing data imputation. For knowledge-driven analysis, machine learning contributes to biomarker detection, classification and regression, biochemical pathway identification, and carbon flux determination. Of important relevance is the combination of different omics data to identify the contributions of the various regulatory levels. Our overview of the recent publications also highlights that data quality determines analysis quality, but also adds to the challenge of choosing the right model for the data. Machine learning methods applied to MS-based metabolomics ease data analysis and can support clinical decisions, guide metabolic engineering, and stimulate fundamental biological discoveries.},

Nutritional metabolomics, through investigating the role that dietary components play in the maintenance of health and development of risk disease, aims to identify new biomarkers that allow the intake of these compounds to be monitored and related to their expected biological effects. This review offers an overview of the application of nutrimetabolomic strategies in the discovery of new biomarkers in human nutritional research, suggesting three main categories: (1) assessment of nutritional and dietary interventions; (2) diet exposure and food consumption monitoring; and (3) health phenotype and metabolic impact of diet. For this purpose, several examples of these applications will be used to provide evidence and to discuss the advantages and drawbacks of these nutrimetabolomic strategies.},

  abstract = {Background Bioinformatic tools for the enrichment of ‘omics’ datasets facilitate interpretation and understanding of data. To date few are suitable for metabolomics datasets. The main objective of this work is to give a critical overview, for the first time, of the performance of these tools. To that aim, datasets from metabolomic repositories were selected and enriched data were created. Both types of data were analysed with these tools and outputs were thoroughly examined. Results An exploratory multivariate analysis of the most used tools for the enrichment of metabolite sets, based on a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) of Jaccard’s distances, was performed and mirrored their diversity. Codes (identifiers) of the metabolites of the datasets were searched in different metabolite databases (HMDB, KEGG, PubChem, ChEBI, BioCyc/HumanCyc, LipidMAPS, ChemSpider, METLIN and Recon2). The databases that presented more identifiers of the metabolites of the dataset were PubChem, followed by METLIN and ChEBI. However, these databases had duplicated entries and might present false positives. The performance of over-representation analysis (ORA) tools, including BioCyc/HumanCyc, ConsensusPathDB, IMPaLA, MBRole, MetaboAnalyst, Metabox, MetExplore, MPEA, PathVisio and Reactome and the mapping tool KEGGREST, was examined. Results were mostly consistent among tools and between real and enriched data despite the variability of the tools. Nevertheless, a few controversial results such as differences in the total number of metabolites were also found. Disease-based enrichment analyses were also assessed, but they were not found to be accurate probably due to the fact that metabolite disease sets are not up-to-date and the difficulty of predicting diseases from a list of metabolites. Conclusions We have extensively reviewed the state-of-the-art of the available range of tools for metabolomic datasets, the completeness of metabolite databases, the performance of ORA methods and disease-based analyses. Despite the variability of the tools, they provided consistent results independent of their analytic approach. However, more work on the completeness of metabolite and pathway databases is required, which strongly affects the accuracy of enrichment analyses. Improvements will be translated into more accurate and global insights of the metabolome.

  abstract = {With the advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies such as Illumina, PacBio, and 10X Genomics platforms, and gas/liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, large volumes of biological data in multiple formats can now be obtained through multi-omics analysis. Bioinformatics is constantly evolving and seeking breakthroughs to solve multi-omics problems; however, it is challenging for most experimental biologists to analyse data using command-line interfaces, coding, and scripting. Based on experience with multi-omics, we have developed OmicsSuite, a desktop suite that comprehensively integrates statistics and multi-omics analysis and visualization. The suite has 175 sub-applications in 12 categories, including Sequence, Statistics, Algorithm, Genomics, Transcriptomics, Enrichment, Proteomics, Metabolomics, Clinical, Microorganism, Single Cell, and Table Operation. We created the user interface with Sequence View, Table View, and intelligent components based on JavaFX and the popular Shiny framework. The multi-omics analysis functions were developed based on BioJava and 300+ packages provided by the R CRAN and Bioconductor communities, and it encompasses over 3000 adjustable parameter interfaces. OmicsSuite can directly read multi-omics raw data in FastA, FastQ, Mutation Annotation Format, mzML, Matrix, and HDF5 formats, and the programs emphasize data transfer directions and pipeline analysis functions. OmicsSuite can produce pre-publication images and tables, allowing users to focus on biological aspects. OmicsSuite offers multi-omics step-by-step workflows that can be easily applied to horticultural plant breeding and molecular mechanism studies in plants. It enables researchers to freely explore the molecular information contained in multi-omics big data (Source: https://github.com/OmicsSuite/, Website: https://omicssuite.github.io, v1.3.9).},

  abstract = {To standardize metabolomics data analysis and facilitate future computational developments, it is essential is have a set of well-defined templates for common data structures. Here we describe a collection of data structures involved in metabolomics data processing and illustrate how they are utilized in a full-featured Python-centric pipeline. We demonstrate the performance of the pipeline, and the details in annotation and quality control using large-scale LC-MS metabolomics and lipidomics data and LC-MS/MS data. Multiple previously published datasets are also reanalyzed to showcase its utility in biological data analysis. This pipeline allows users to streamline data processing, quality control, annotation, and standardization in an efficient and transparent manner. This work fills a major gap in the Python ecosystem for computational metabolomics. Author Summary All life processes involve the consumption, creation, and interconversion of metabolites. Metabolomics is the comprehensive study of these small molecules, often using mass spectrometry, to provide critical information of health and disease. Automated processing of such metabolomics data is desired, especially for the bioinformatics community with familiar tools and infrastructures. Despite of Python’s popularity in bioinformatics and machine learning, the Python ecosystem in computational metabolomics still misses a complete data pipeline. We have developed an end-to-end computational metabolomics data processing pipeline, based on the raw data preprocessor Asari [1]. Our pipeline takes experimental data in .mzML or .raw format and outputs annotated feature tables for subsequent biological interpretation. We demonstrate the application of this pipeline to multiple metabolomics and lipidomics datasets. Accompanying the pipeline, we have designed a set of reusable data structures, released as the MetDataModel package, which shall promote more consistent terminology and software interoperability in this area.},

  abstract = {In most ethnicities at least a quarter of all cases with diabetes is assumed to be undiagnosed. Screening for diabetes using saliva has been suggested as an effective approach to identify affected individuals.The objective of the study was to identify a noninvasive metabolic marker of type 2 diabetes in saliva.In a case-control study of type 2 diabetes, we used a clinical metabolomics discovery study to screen for diabetes-relevant metabolic readouts in saliva, using blood and urine as a reference. With a combination of three metabolomics platforms based on nontargeted mass spectrometry, we examined 2178 metabolites in saliva, blood plasma, and urine samples from 188 subjects with type 2 diabetes and 181 controls of Arab and Asian ethnicities.We found a strong association of type 2 diabetes with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) in saliva (P = 3.6 × 10−13). Levels of 1,5-AG in saliva highly correlated with 1,5-AG levels in blood and inversely correlated with blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels. These findings were robust across three different non-Caucasian ethnicities (Arabs, South Asians, and Filipinos), irrespective of body mass index, age, and gender.Clinical studies have already established 1,5-AG in blood as a reliable marker of short-term glycemic control. Our study suggests that 1,5-AG in saliva can be used in national screening programs for undiagnosed diabetes, which are of particular interest for Middle Eastern countries with young populations and exceptionally high diabetes rates.},

  abstract = {Scope To identify the most discriminant dietary biomarkers of nuts exposure in subjects with metabolic syndrome (MetS), and investigate the potential association between exposure and the severity of the MetS diagnostic traits. Methods and results We applied the untargeted LC-ESI-qToF-MS-driven metabolomic workflow to explore the changes occurring in the plasma metabolome of MetS subjects following 12-wk intake of mixed nuts (30 g/d; nuts versus control groups). Urolithin A glucuronide was the most discriminative biomarker of nuts exposure, showing the highest predictive capacity (area under the ROC curve = 89.6\% [80.8–98.4]) despite the interindividual variation expected for a host-microbial cometabolite. Furthermore, the detection of urolithin A glucuronide in plasma showed significant inverse correlation with basal abdominal adiposity (waist circumference: r = −0.550, p {$<$} 0.01; waist-hip ratio: r = −0.409, p {$<$} 0.05) and impaired glycemic control (fasting insulin: r = −0.414, p {$<$} 0.05; HOMA-IR: r = −0.417, p {$<$} 0.05). Significant changes in medium-chain dicarboxylic acids, recognized as alternative energy substrates that are particularly relevant in the case of glycemic control impairment, were also associated with nut consumption. Conclusion Higher levels of utolithin A glucuronide are reported in subjects with less severe MetS traits, especially in females. We believe that this inverse correlation may be related with profile of gut microbial dysbiosis, recently associated to subjects with MetS.},

  abstract = {Nutrition is central to sustenance of good health, not to mention its role as a cultural object that brings together or draws lines among societies. Undoubtedly, understanding the future paths of nutrition science in the current era of Big Data remains firmly on science, technology, and innovation strategy agendas around the world. Nutrigenomics, the confluence of nutrition science with genomics, brought about a new focus on and legitimacy for “variability science” (i.e., the study of mechanisms of person-to-person and population differences in response to food, and the ways in which food variably impacts the host, for example, nutrient-related disease outcomes). Societal expectations, both public and private, and claims over genomics-guided and individually-tailored precision diets continue to proliferate. While the prospects of nutrition science, and nutrigenomics in particular, are established, there is a need to integrate the efforts in four Big Data domains that are naturally allied—agrigenomics, nutrigenomics, nutriproteomics, and nutrimetabolomics—that address complementary variability questions pertaining to individual differences in response to food-related environmental exposures. The joint use of these four omics knowledge domains, coined as Precision Nutrition 4.0 here, has sadly not been realized to date, but the potentials for such integrated knowledge innovation are enormous. Future personalized nutrition practices would benefit from a seamless planning of life sciences funding, research, and practice agendas from “farm to clinic to supermarket to society,” and from “genome to proteome to metabolome.” Hence, this innovation foresight analysis explains the already existing potentials waiting to be realized, and suggests ways forward for innovation in both technology and ethics foresight frames on precision nutrition. We propose the creation of a new Precision Nutrition Evidence Barometer for periodic, independent, and ongoing retrieval, screening, and aggregation of the relevant life sciences data. For innovation in Big Data ethics oversight, we suggest “nested governance” wherein the processes of knowledge production are made transparent in the continuum from life sciences and social sciences to humanities, and where each innovation actor reports to another accountability and transparency layer: scientists to ethicists, and ethicists to scholars in the emerging field of ethics-of-ethics. Such nested innovation ecosystems offer safety against innovation blind spots, calibrate visible/invisible power differences in the cultures of science or ethics, and ultimately, reducing the risk of “paper values”—what people say—and “real values”—what innovation actors actually do. We are optimistic that the convergence of nutrigenomics with nutriproteomics, nutrimetabolomics, and agrigenomics can build a robust, sustainable, and trustworthy precision nutrition 4.0 agenda, as articulated in this Big Data and ethics foresight analysis.},

The key features of MetaboAnalystR 4.0 includes an auto-optimized feature detection and quantification algorithm for LC-MS1 spectra processing, efficient MS2 spectra deconvolution and compound identification for data-dependent or data-independent acquisition, and more accurate functional interpretation through integrated spectral annotation. Comprehensive validation studies using LC-MS1 and MS2 spectra obtained from standards mixtures, dilution series and clinical metabolomics samples have shown its excellent performance across a wide range of common tasks such as peak picking, spectral deconvolution, and compound identification with good computing efficiency. Together with its existing statistical analysis utilities, MetaboAnalystR 4.0 represents a significant step toward a unified, end-to-end workflow for LC-MS based global metabolomics in the open-source R environment.},

We illustrate how urinary metabolic phenotyping can be used as an alternative approach to obtain information on dietary patterns. We used two multipass 24\,h dietary recalls, obtained on two occasions on average 3 weeks apart, paired with two 24\,h urine collections from 1,848 US individuals; 67 nutrients influenced the urinary metabotype (metabolic phenotype) of 46 structurally identified metabolites characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy. We investigated the stability of each metabolite over time and showed that the urinary metabolic profile is more stable within individuals than reported dietary patterns. The 46 metabolites accurately predicted healthy and unhealthy dietary patterns in a free-living US cohort, and these predictions were replicated in an independent UK cohort. We mapped these metabolites into a host-microbial metabolic network to identify key pathways and functions related to diet. These data can be used in future studies to evaluate how this set of diet-derived, stable, measurable bioanalytical markers is associated with disease risk. This knowledge may give new insights into biological pathways that characterize the shift from a healthy to an unhealthy metabolic phenotype and hence indicate entry points for prevention and intervention strategies.},

  abstract = {Metabolic abnormalities lead to the dysfunction of metabolic pathways and metabolite accumulation or deficiency which is well-recognized hallmarks of diseases. Metabolite signatures that have close proximity to subject’s phenotypic informative dimension, are useful for predicting diagnosis and prognosis of diseases as well as monitoring treatments. The lack of early biomarkers could lead to poor diagnosis and serious outcomes. Therefore, noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring methods with high specificity and selectivity are desperately needed. Small molecule metabolites-based metabolomics has become a specialized tool for metabolic biomarker and pathway analysis, for revealing possible mechanisms of human various diseases and deciphering therapeutic potentials. It could help identify functional biomarkers related to phenotypic variation and delineate biochemical pathways changes as early indicators of pathological dysfunction and damage prior to disease development. Recently, scientists have established a large number of metabolic profiles to reveal the underlying mechanisms and metabolic networks for therapeutic target exploration in biomedicine. This review summarized the metabolic analysis on the potential value of small-molecule candidate metabolites as biomarkers with clinical events, which may lead to better diagnosis, prognosis, drug screening and treatment. We also discuss challenges that need to be addressed to fuel the next wave of breakthroughs.},

  abstract = {Metabolomics, the systematic analysis of low molecular weight biochemical compounds in a biological specimen, has been increasingly applied to biomarker discovery.Because no single analytical method can accommodate the chemical diversity of the entire metabolome, various methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) have been employed, with the latter coupled to an array of separation techniques including gas and liquid chromatography. Whereas NMR can provide structural information and absolute quantification for select metabolites without the use of exogenous standards, MS tends to have much higher analytical sensitivity, enabling broader surveys of the metabolome. Both NMR and MS can be used to characterize metabolite data either in a targeted manner or in a nontargeted, pattern-recognition manner. In addition to technical considerations, careful sample selection and study design are important to minimize potential confounding influences on the metabolome, including diet, medications, and comorbitidies. To this end, metabolite profiling has been applied to human biomarker discovery in small-scale interventions, in which individuals are extremely well phenotyped and able to serve as their own biological controls, as well as in larger epidemiological cohorts. Understanding how metabolites relate to each other and to established risk markers for diseases such as diabetes and renal failure will be important in evaluating the potential value of these metabolites as clinically useful biomarkers.Applied to both experimental and epidemiological study designs, metabolite profiling has begun to highlight the breadth metabolic disturbances that accompany human disease. Experimental work in model systems and integration with other functional genomic approaches will be required to establish a causal link between select biomarkers and disease pathogenesis.},

Metabolomics aims to measure a wide breadth of small molecules in the context of physiological stimuli or disease states. Metabolomics methodologies fall into two distinct groups: untargeted metabolomics, an intended comprehensive analysis of all the measurable analytes in a sample including chemical unknowns, and targeted metabolomics, the measurement of defined groups of chemically characterized and biochemically annotated metabolites. The methodologies considered in this unit focus on the processes of conducting targeted metabolomics experiments, and the advantages of this general approach are highlighted herein. This unit outlines procedures for extracting nitrogenous metabolites (including amino acids), lipids, and intermediary metabolites (including TCA cycle oxoacids) from blood plasma.

  abstract = {Spectral data preprocessing is an integral and sometimes inevitable part of chemometric analyses. For Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra a possible first preprocessing step is a phase correction which is applied to the Fourier transformed free induction decay (FID) signal. This preprocessing step can be followed by a separate baseline correction step. Especially if series of high-resolution spectra are considered, then automated and computationally fast preprocessing routines are desirable. A new method is suggested that applies the phase and the baseline corrections simultaneously in an automated form without manual input, which distinguishes this work from other approaches. The underlying multi-objective optimization or Pareto optimization provides improved results compared to consecutively applied correction steps. The optimization process uses an objective function which applies strong penalty constraints and weaker regularization conditions. The new method includes an approach for the detection of zero baseline regions. The baseline correction uses a modified Whittaker smoother. The functionality of the new method is demonstrated for experimental NMR spectra. The results are verified against gravimetric data. The method is compared to alternative preprocessing tools. Additionally, the simultaneous correction method is compared to a consecutive application of the two correction steps.},

Through the development of omics technology over the last two decades, the definition of food and nutrition has changed from sources of energy and major/micro-nutrients to an essential exposure factor that determines health risks. Furthermore, this new approach has enabled nutrition research to identify dietary biomarkers and to deepen the understanding of metabolic dynamics and the impacts on health risks. However, so far, candidate markers identified by metabolomics have not been clinically applied and more efforts should be made to validate those. To help nutrition researchers better understand the potential of its application, this scoping review outlined the historical transition, recent focuses, and future prospects of the new realm, based on trends in the number of human research articles from the early stage of 2000 to the present of 2019 by searching the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE). Among them, objective dietary assessment, metabolic profiling, and health risk prediction were positioned as three of the principal applications.

  abstract = {We define breathomics as the metabolomics study of exhaled air. It is a strongly emerging metabolomics research field that mainly focuses on health-related volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Since the amount of these compounds varies with health status, breathomics holds great promise to deliver non-invasive diagnostic tools. Thus, the main aim of breathomics is to find patterns of VOCs related to abnormal (for instance inflammatory) metabolic processes occurring in the human body. Recently, analytical methods for measuring VOCs in exhaled air with high resolution and high throughput have been extensively developed. Yet, the application of machine learning methods for fingerprinting VOC profiles in the breathomics is still in its infancy. Therefore, in this paper, we describe the current state of the art in data pre-processing and multivariate analysis of breathomics data. We start with the detailed pre-processing pipelines for breathomics data obtained from gas-chromatography mass spectrometry and an ion-mobility spectrometer coupled to multi-capillary columns. The outcome of data pre-processing is a matrix containing the relative abundances of a set of VOCs for a group of patients under different conditions (e.g. disease stage, treatment). Independently of the utilized analytical method, the most important question, ‘which VOCs are discriminatory?’, remains the same. Answers can be given by several modern machine learning techniques (multivariate statistics) and, therefore, are the focus of this paper. We demonstrate the advantages as well the drawbacks of such techniques. We aim to help the community to understand how to profit from a particular method. In parallel, we hope to make the community aware of the existing data fusion methods, as yet unresearched in breathomics.},

A major benefit of such an environment is the possibility of connecting different tools into more complex workflows. Combining reusable data processing R scripts with the experimental data thus allows for open, reproducible research. This review provides an extensive overview of existing packages in R for different steps in a typical computational metabolomics workflow, including data processing, biostatistics, metabolite annotation and identification, and biochemical network and pathway analysis.

Quantification of proteins in MS analysis can be affected by variations in technical factors such as sample preparation and data acquisition conditions leading to batch effects, which adds to noise in the data set.

To illustrate the relevance of the tool, we explore two case studies, including an iPSC-derived cell study and a Covid vaccine study to show different context-specific use cases. Ultimately this tool can be used as an extremely powerful approach for eliminating technical bias while retaining biological bias, toward understanding disease mechanisms and potential therapeutics.},

  abstract = {Metabolomics as a research field and a set of techniques is to study the entire small molecules in biological samples. Metabolomics is emerging as a powerful tool generally for precision medicine. Particularly, integration of microbiome and metabolome has revealed the mechanism and functionality of microbiome in human health and disease. However, metabolomics data are very complicated. Preprocessing/pretreating and normalizing procedures on metabolomics data are usually required before statistical analysis. In this review article, we comprehensively review various methods that are used to preprocess and pretreat metabolomics data, including MS-based data and NMR -based data preprocessing, dealing with zero and/or missing values and detecting outliers, data normalization, data centering and scaling, data transformation. We discuss the advantages and limitations of each method. The choice for a suitable preprocessing method is determined by the biological hypothesis, the characteristics of the data set, and the selected statistical data analysis method. We then provide the perspective of their applications in the microbiome and metabolome research.},

  abstract = {Nutrition is an interdisciplinary science that studies the interactions of nutrients with the body in relation to maintenance of health and well-being. Nutrition is highly complex due to the underlying various internal and external factors that could model it. Thus, hacking this complexity requires more holistic and network-based strategies that could unveil these dynamic system interactions at both time and space scales. The ongoing omics era with its high-throughput molecular data generation is paving the way to embrace this complexity and is deeply reshaping the whole field of nutrition. Understanding the future paths of nutrition science is of importance from both translational and clinical perspectives. Basic nutrients which might include metabolites are important in nutrition science. Moreover, metabolites are key biological communication channels and represent an appealing functional readout at the interface of different major influential factors that define health and disease. Metabolomics is the technology that enables holistic and systematic analyses of metabolites in a biological system. Hence, given its intrinsic functionality, its tight connection to metabolism and its high clinical actionability potential, metabolomics is a very appealing technology for nutrition science. The ultimate goal is to deliver a tailored and clinically relevant nutritional recommendations and interventions to achieve precision nutrition. This work intends to present an update on the applications of metabolomics to personalize nutrition in translational and clinical settings. It also discusses the current conceptual shifts that are remodeling clinical nutrition practices in this Precision Medicine era. Finally, perspectives of clinical nutrition in the ever-growing, data-driven healthcare landscape are presented.},

As a consequence, characterization of the variations of the urine metabolome under basal conditions becomes critical in order to avoid confounding effects in cohort studies. Such physiological information is however very scarce in the literature and in metabolomics databases so far. Here we studied the influence of age, body mass index (BMI), and gender on metabolite concentrations in a large cohort of 183 adults by using liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). We implemented a comprehensive statistical workflow for univariate hypothesis testing and modeling by orthogonal partial least-squares (OPLS), which we made available to the metabolomics community within the online Workflow4Metabolomics.org resource. We found 108 urine metabolites displaying concentration variations with either age, BMI, or gender, by integrating the results from univariate p-values and multivariate variable importance in projection (VIP). Several metabolite clusters were further evidenced by correlation analysis, and they allowed stratification of the cohort. In conclusion, our study highlights the impact of gender and age on the urinary metabolome, and thus it indicates that these factors should be taken into account for the design of metabolomics studies.},

Substantial preprocessing, which requires machine learning (ML), human judgment, and specialized software, is required to transform Big Data into artificial intelligence (AI)- and ML-ready data. These preprocessing steps are the most complex part of the entire modeling pipeline. Understanding the complexity of these steps by the end user is critical for reducing misunderstanding, faulty interpretation, and erroneous downstream conclusions. Methods We reviewed three popular obesity/nutrition Big Data sources: microbiome, metabolomics, and accelerometry.

Results Opportunities for advances to improve quality control, speed of preprocessing, and intelligent end user consumption were presented. Conclusions Big Data have the exciting potential for identifying new modifiable factors that impact obesity research. However, to ensure accurate interpretation of conclusions arising from Big Data, the choices involved in preparing AI- and ML-ready data need to be transparent to investigators and clinicians relying on the conclusions.},

The pathophysiology of delirium is poorly understood, and no blood-based, predictive markers are available. We characterized the plasma metabolome of 52 delirium cases and 52 matched controls from the Successful Aging after Elective Surgery (SAGES) cohort (N\,=\,560) of patients\,≥\,70~years old without dementia undergoing scheduled major non-cardiac surgery. We applied targeted mass spectrometry with internal standards and pooled controls using a nested matched case-control study preoperatively (PREOP) and on postoperative day 2 (POD2) to identify potential delirium risk and disease markers. Univariate analyses identified 37 PREOP and 53 POD2 metabolites associated with delirium and multivariate analyses achieved significant separation between the two groups with an 11-metabolite prediction model at PREOP (AUC\,=\,83.80\%). Systems biology analysis using the metabolites with differential concentrations rendered “valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis” at PREOP and “citrate cycle” at POD2 as the most significantly enriched pathways (false discovery rate\,{$<$}\,0.05). Perturbations in energy metabolism and amino acid synthesis pathways may be associated with postoperative delirium and suggest potential mechanisms for delirium pathogenesis. Our results could lead to the development of a metabolomic delirium predictor.},

  abstract = {The life sciences are currently being transformed by an unprecedented wave of developments in molecular analysis, which include important advances in instrumental analysis as well as biocomputing. In light of the central role played by metabolism in nutrition, metabolomics is rapidly being established as a key analytical tool in human nutritional studies. Consequently, an increasing number of nutritionists integrate metabolomics into their study designs. Within this dynamic landscape, the potential of nutritional metabolomics (nutrimetabolomics) to be translated into a science, which can impact on health policies, still needs to be realized. A key element to reach this goal is the ability of the research community to join, to collectively make the best use of the potential offered by nutritional metabolomics. This article, therefore, provides a methodological description of nutritional metabolomics that reflects on the state-of-the-art techniques used in the laboratories of the Food Biomarker Alliance (funded by the European Joint Programming Initiative “A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life” (JPI HDHL)) as well as points of reflections to harmonize this field. It is not intended to be exhaustive but rather to present a pragmatic guidance on metabolomic methodologies, providing readers with useful “tips and tricks” along the analytical workflow.},

Normalization is the process that aims to account for the bias and make samples more comparable. The selection of a proper normalization method is a pivotal task for the reliability of the downstream analysis and results. Many normalization methods commonly used in proteomics have been adapted from the DNA microarray techniques. Previous studies comparing normalization methods in proteomics have focused mainly on intragroup variation. In this study, several popular and widely used normalization methods representing different strategies in normalization are evaluated using three spike-in and one experimental mouse label-free proteomic data sets. The normalization methods are evaluated in terms of their ability to reduce variation between technical replicates, their effect on differential expression analysis and their effect on the estimation of logarithmic fold changes. Additionally, we examined whether normalizing the whole data globally or in segments for the differential expression analysis has an effect on the performance of the normalization methods. We found that variance stabilization normalization (Vsn) reduced variation the most between technical replicates in all examined data sets. Vsn also performed consistently well in the differential expression analysis. Linear regression normalization and local regression normalization performed also systematically well. Finally, we discuss the choice of a normalization method and some qualities of a suitable normalization method in the light of the results of our evaluation.},

Current peak realignment methods are generally time-consuming or align major peaks at the expense of minor peak shift accuracy. We present a novel recursive segment-wise peak alignment (RSPA) method to reduce variability in peak positions across the multiple (1)H NMR spectra used in metabonomic studies. The method refines a segmentation of reference and test spectra in a top-down fashion, sequentially subdividing the initial larger segments, as required, to improve the local spectral alignment. We also describe a general procedure that allows robust comparison of realignment quality of various available methods for a range of peak intensities. The RSPA method is illustrated with respect to 140 (1)H NMR rat urine spectra from a caloric restriction study and is compared with several other widely used peak alignment methods. We demonstrate the superior performance of the RSPA alignment over a wide range of peaks and its capacity to enhance interpretability and robustness of multivariate statistical tools. The approach is widely applicable for NMR-based metabolic studies and is potentially suitable for many other types of data sets such as chromatographic profiles and MS data.},

  abstract = {Pooling metabolomics data across studies is often desirable to increase the statistical power of the analysis. However, this can raise methodological challenges as several preanalytical and analytical factors could introduce differences in measured concentrations and variability between datasets. Specifically, different studies may use variable sample types (e.g., serum versus plasma) collected, treated, and stored according to different protocols, and assayed in different laboratories using different instruments. To address these issues, a new pipeline was developed to normalize and pool metabolomics data through a set of sequential steps: (i) exclusions of the least informative observations and metabolites and removal of outliers; imputation of missing data; (ii) identification of the main sources of variability through principal component partial R-square (PC-PR2) analysis; (iii) application of linear mixed models to remove unwanted variability, including samples’ originating study and batch, and preserve biological variations while accounting for potential differences in the residual variances across studies. This pipeline was applied to targeted metabolomics data acquired using Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ kits in eight case-control studies nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. Comprehensive examination of metabolomics measurements indicated that the pipeline improved the comparability of data across the studies. Our pipeline can be adapted to normalize other molecular data, including biomarkers as well as proteomics data, and could be used for pooling molecular datasets, for example in international consortia, to limit biases introduced by inter-study variability. This versatility of the pipeline makes our work of potential interest to molecular epidemiologists.},

Various methods have been applied for handling missing values, but the selection can significantly affect following data analyses. Typically, there are three types of missing values, missing not at random (MNAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing completely at random (MCAR). Our study comprehensively compared eight imputation methods (zero, half minimum (HM), mean, median, random forest (RF), singular value decomposition (SVD), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and quantile regression imputation of left-censored data (QRILC)) for different types of missing values using four metabolomics datasets. Normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) and NRMSE-based sum of ranks (SOR) were applied to evaluate imputation accuracy. Principal component analysis (PCA)/partial least squares (PLS)-Procrustes analysis were used to evaluate the overall sample distribution. Student’s t-test followed by correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects on univariate statistics. Our findings demonstrated that RF performed the best for MCAR/MAR and QRILC was the favored one for left-censored MNAR. Finally, we proposed a comprehensive strategy and developed a public-accessible web-tool for the application of missing value imputation in metabolomics (https://metabolomics.cc.hawaii.edu/software/MetImp/).},

The role of amino acids, which provide the body with energy, in the development of HF is still unclear. The aim of this study was to explore changes in serum amino acids in patients with HF and identify potential biomarkers. First, the serum amino acid metabolism profiles of 44 patients with HF and 30 healthy controls (Con) were quantitatively measured. Then, candidate markers were identified through the utilization of T test, multivariate statistical analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The results found that there were 11 amino acid levels that were significantly different between patients with HF and Con. Based on ROC curve analysis, the biomarkers of eight amino acids (Glutamic acid, Taurine, l-aspartic acid, l-ornithine, Ethanolamine, l-Serine, l-Sarcosine, and Cysteine) showed high sensitivity and specificity (AUC\,{$>$}\,0.90), and binary logistic regression analysis was used in MetaboAnalyst 5.0. Among the amino acids examined, six exhibited notable alterations in accordance with the severity of HF. In conclusion, this study cannot only provide clinicians with an objective diagnostic approach for the early identification of HF, but also enhances comprehension of the underlying mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of HF.},

  abstract = {In the field of data analysis, it is often faced with a large number of missing values, especially in metabolomics data, this problem is more prominent. Data imputation is a common method to deal with missing metabolomics data, while traditional data imputation methods usually ignore the differences in missing types, and thus the results of data imputation are not satisfactory. In order to discriminate the missing types of metabolomics data, a missing data classification model (PX-MDC) based on particle swarm algorithm and XGBoost is proposed in this paper. First, the missing values in a given missing data set are obtained by panning the missing values to obtain the largest subset of complete data, and then the particle swarm algorithm is used to search for the concentration threshold of missing data and the proportion of low concentration deletions as a percentage of overall deletions. Next, the missing data are simulated based on the search results. Finally, the training data are trained using the XGBoost model using the feature set proposed in this paper in order to build a classifier for the missing data. The experimental results show that the particle swarm algorithm is able to match the traditional enumeration method in terms of accuracy and significantly reduce the search time in concentration threshold search. Compared with the current mainstream methods, the PX-MDC model designed in this paper exhibits higher accuracy and is able to distinguish different deletion types for the same metabolite. This study is expected to make an important breakthrough in metabolomics data imputation and provide strong support for research in related fields.},

Associations of cytosine-guanine di-nucleotide (CpG) methylation with clinical endpoints that overlap with metabolic phenotypes suggest a regulatory role for these CpG sites in the body’s response to disease or environmental stress. We previously identified 20 CpG sites in an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) with metabolomics that were also associated in recent EWASs with diabetes-, obesity-, and smoking-related endpoints. To elucidate the molecular pathways that connect these potentially regulatory CpG sites to the associated disease or lifestyle factors, we conducted a multi-omics association study including 2474 mass-spectrometry-based metabolites in plasma, urine and saliva, 225 NMR-based lipid and metabolite measures in blood, 1124 blood-circulating proteins using aptamer technology, 113 plasma protein N-glycans and 60 IgG-glyans, using 359 samples from the multi-ethnic Qatar Metabolomics Study on Diabetes (QMDiab). We report 138 multi-omics associations at these CpG sites, including diabetes biomarkers at the diabetes-associated TXNIP locus, and smoking-specific metabolites and proteins at multiple smoking-associated loci, including AHRR. Mendelian randomization suggests a causal effect of metabolite levels on methylation of obesity-associated CpG sites, i.e. of glycerophospholipid PC(O-36: 5), glycine and a very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL-A) on the methylation of the obesity-associated CpG loci DHCR24, MYO5C and CPT1A, respectively. Taken together, our study suggests that multi-omics-associated CpG methylation can provide functional read-outs for the underlying regulatory response mechanisms to disease or environmental insults.},

It could enable mapping of perturbations of early biochemical changes in diseases and hence provide an opportunity to develop predictive biomarkers that could result in earlier intervention and provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of diseases. Because of the possible discovery of clinically relevant biomarkers, metabolomics has potential advantages that routine approaches to clinical diagnosis do not. Monitoring specific metabolite levels in serum, the most commonly used biofluid in metabolomics, has become an important way of detecting the early stages of a disease. Serum is a readily accessible and informative biofluid, making it ideal for early detection of a wide range of diseases, and analysis of serum has several advantages over analysis of other biofluids. Metabolite profiles of serum can be regarded as important indicators of physiological and pathological states and may aid understanding of the mechanism of disease occurrence and progression on the metabolic level, and provide information enabling identification of early and differential metabolic markers of disease. Analysis of these crucial metabolites in serum has become important in monitoring the state of biological organisms and is widely used for diagnosis of disease. Emerging metabolomics will drive serum analysis, facilitate and improve the development of disease treatments, and provide great benefits for public health in the long-term.},

  abstract = {Cellular metabolomics, which involves targeted and untargeted analyses of metabolites in in vitro systems, plays a pivotal role in system biology. It offers insights into cell phenotypes and provides a means to monitor cellular activities. The power of cellular metabolomics stems from its abilities to quantify and identify metabolites in a cellular system and to distill the acquired information with various data analysis tools. In comparison to in vivo studies that utilize sera, tissues, and body fluids, cellular metabolomics is not only more cost-effective and controllable but also highly informative about biological functions. This review delves into the intricacies of sample preparation workflows, data acquisition platforms, and data mining and analysis techniques for cellular metabolomic studies, with 127 references cited. We explore the merits and limitations of metabolomics strategies, i.e., targeted and untargeted, aiming to provide readers with a clear understanding of the step-by-step procedures and what can be achieved when executing a cellular metabolomics experiment.},

  abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent and deadly cancers in the world. Despite an expanding knowledge of its molecular pathogenesis during the past two decades, robust biomarkers to enable screening, surveillance, and therapy monitoring of CRC are still lacking. In this study, we present a targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolic profiling approach for identifying biomarker candidates that could enable highly sensitive and specific CRC detection using human serum samples. In this targeted approach, 158 metabolites from 25 metabolic pathways of potential significance were monitored in 234 serum samples from three groups of patients (66 CRC patients, 76 polyp patients, and 92 healthy controls). Partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models were established, which proved to be powerful for distinguishing CRC patients from both healthy controls and polyp patients. Receiver operating characteristic curves generated based on these PLS-DA models showed high sensitivities (0.96 and 0.89, respectively, for differentiating CRC patients from healthy controls or polyp patients), good specificities (0.80 and 0.88), and excellent areas under the curve (0.93 and 0.95). Monte Carlo cross validation was also applied, demonstrating the robust diagnostic power of this metabolic profiling approach.},
